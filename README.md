# rc5-cassette-deck-controller

A simple Arduino project which adds an infrared remote control to a logic-controlled cassette deck. An RC-5 remote control controls a Yamaha K-220 cassette deck in this project, but it can be easily adapted to control other cassette decks. Uses [guyc's RC5 library](https://github.com/guyc/RC5).
